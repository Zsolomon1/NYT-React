# NYT-React
This is a developed application that utilizes the New York Times API. The idea is to use key terms to execute a search function where
It will retrieve article based ont he parameters that you enter prior to search. Once the articles are retreaved and you want to save it for later,
there is a save option that stores the article in a database. This application was built with the use of React, Node, Express, and MongoDb with 
a Heroku link.
